# Teachable Machine Balaji Wafer Classifier

This is an ICSE Class 10 Artificial Intelligence project using Google Teachable Machine to classify two varieties of Balaji wafer products:

* **Balaji Rumbles Wafer** (801 images)
* **Balaji Pizzy Masala Wafer** (712 images)

The model was trained to identify these two classes with high accuracy.

## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates how an AI system can learn to recognize images using Teachable Machine, and then be deployed on the web using GitHub + Vercel.

It includes:

* Image classification with Teachable Machine
* Exported model hosted on Teachable Machine
* A simple website built with HTML/Tailwind CSS
* Deployed publicly using Vercel

## üöÄ Deployment

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ GitHub

* Repository for code storage: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) (replace with your actual repo link)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Vercel

* Free deployment platform: [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
* After importing this GitHub repo to Vercel, the site will be automatically deployed at a live URL.
